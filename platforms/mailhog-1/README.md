## <a id="configuration"></a>Service Configuration

There is a dedicated GNU Make file and the main Docker directory with the required scripts to build the required platform configuration.

This service platform is designed to be managed by a parent `./../../.env` but, as it feeds `./docker/.env` through GNU Make, it can be edited manually.

If no GNU Make is in used, create a copy from the example `./docker/.env.example` into `./docker/.env`.

The service container can be easily manage by the `./docker/docker-compose.yml`.

Require environment variables at `./docker/.env` *(all are customizable)*:
```bash
COMPOSE_PROJECT_LEAD="myproj"                       # <- lead abbreviation or acronym as part of related containers naming rule -------------------------> #
COMPOSE_PROJECT_CNET="mp-dev"                       # <- real main image keys to manage automations for sharing resources -------------------------------> #
COMPOSE_PROJECT_IMGK="alpine-3.22-mailhog"          # <- container name to build the service - it is important to set the environment in this variable --> #
COMPOSE_PROJECT_HOST="127.0.0.1"                    # <- machine hostname referrer - not necessary for this project -------------------------------------> #
COMPOSE_PROJECT_PORT=7504                           # <- local machine port opened for container service ------------------------------------------------> #
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME="mp-mailhog-dev"               # <- container name to build the service - it is important to set the environment in this variable --> #
COMPOSE_PROJECT_CPUS="2.00"                         # <- container's maximum CPUs usage to apply by docker-compose - leave it empty for full usage ------> #
COMPOSE_PROJECT_MEM="128M"                          # <- container's maximum CPUs usage to apply by docker-compose - leave it empty for full usage ------> #
COMPOSE_PROJECT_SWAP="256M"                         # <- container's RAM swap space in storage executed by automation command ---------------------------> #
COMPOSE_PROJECT_APP_PORT=7505                       # <- application ui management port -----------------------------------------------------------------> #
```

### Containers Access Modes

- Set the required environment values in `./docker/.env` from `./docker/.env.example` if no GNU Make will be applied.
- Set the required configuration files by coping and updating them depending on your project requirements.
- Container availability by building the container with `docker-composer.yml` in separated configuration layers
    - Stand-alone
        - The container is intended to be published directly and accessed from the host network, typically via `0.0.0.0:<port>`. It does not require a shared Docker network. It is a common setting for local development.
    - Inside a Custom Network
        - The container is attached to a custom Docker network and is intended to be accessed through a reverse proxy or other containers on the same network.
        - This network setting is useful for isolating services while still allowing container-to-container communication.
        - It is a strongly recommended setting for remote deployment to avoid exposing the localhost port in used and protect by firewall.
        - <b>Connect from one container to another inside the custom network, by container name and its own exposed port</b>.
    - Host-Gateway
        - The container can reach services running on the host machine using the Docker host gateway mapping. This is useful when the container must access local services on the VPS/host, while public access is still handled through a reverse proxy. It is a recommended setting for remote deployment too.
    - Public exposure is controlled by the `ports` mapping.
    - `0.0.0.0:<port>` means externally accessible.
    - `127.0.0.1:<port>` means local-only access on the host and requires a reverse proxy, e.g. NGINX.
    - Docker network attachment controls container-to-container communication.
    - Host-gateway controls container-to-host communication.

## <a id="management"></a>Service Management

To manage the container, run the GNU Make recipes
```bash
$ make help
Usage: $ make [target]
Targets:
$ make help                           shows this Makefile help message
$ make port-check                     shows this project port availability on local machine
$ make env                            checks if docker .env file exists
$ make env-set                        sets docker .env file
$ make info                           shows container information
$ make ssh                            enters the container shell
$ make up                             starts and recreates containers if compose config or image changed, runnning in detached mode
$ make build                          builds and ensures changes in the Dockerfile, build steps, or copied-in files are applied. Not --no-recreate
$ make network                        starts up into an existing custom network for container-to-container communication, runnning in detached mode
$ make start                          starts the container and put on running from latest configuration
$ make stop                           stops the running container but data won't be destroyed
$ make restart                        restarts the running container
$ make clear                          removes container from Docker running containers
$ make destroy                        delete container image from Docker cache
$ make dev                            sets a development enviroment
```
